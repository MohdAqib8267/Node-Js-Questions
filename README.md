# Node-Js-Questions
# What is node JS in simple words?
Node. js (Node) is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language.

# What is Middleware?
Middleware is a function in Node.js <br/>
Operates between the server and routes<br/>
Can process incoming requests before they reach route handler<br/>
Can perform operations such as authentication, logging, validation, etc.<br/>
Middleware functions are executed in the order in which they are added to the request pipeline and can modify the request and response objects, or end the request-response cycle.

<h4>example </h4>
```const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Define a middleware function
const logMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Received a ${req.method} request from ${req.url}`);
  next();
};

// Use the middleware function
app.use(logMiddleware);

// Define a route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});```
